The media and entertainment industry is now changing a lot with the application of AI. Of the many applications of AI in this field, sentiment analysis stands out as a major tool of understanding audience reactions. This study covers analysis of YouTube comments employing NLP techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression. The dataset including user comments which are rated in either of the three categories: positive-negative-neutral allows for sentiment classification. Some level of sarcasm and ambiguous language made the model struggle with classification and it achieved an accuracy of 76% after data cleaning and preprocessing. Different visualization techniques such as word clouds, sentiment distributions, and confusion matrices enable deeper insight into audience opinions. The study underscores that advanced NLP models such as LogitReg would be a lot more useful as result enhancement for appreciable accuracy while interpreting the users' emotions would be a lot easier as well. The study revealed the insight that AI-infused sentiment analysis can allow media platforms to enhance user experience and content recommendation.
